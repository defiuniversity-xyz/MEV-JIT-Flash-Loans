  EVM: 'Ethereum Virtual Machine — the computation engine that executes smart contract code on Ethereum and compatible blockchains.',
  AMM: 'Automated Market Maker — a protocol that uses mathematical formulas (like x*y=k) to price assets instead of an order book. Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer are AMMs.',
  DEX: 'Decentralized Exchange — a peer-to-peer marketplace for trading crypto tokens directly from your wallet, without a central intermediary.',
  LP: 'Liquidity Provider — a user who deposits tokens into an AMM pool to earn trading fees. LPs take on impermanent loss risk.',
  TWAP: 'Time-Weighted Average Price — the average price of an asset over a set number of blocks. Much harder to manipulate than spot price because an attacker would need to sustain manipulation across many blocks.',
  slippage: 'The difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual execution price. Caused by insufficient liquidity or price movement during transaction confirmation.',
  impermanentLoss: 'The unrealized loss an LP experiences when the price ratio of deposited tokens diverges from the deposit ratio. Called "impermanent" because it reverses if prices return to the original ratio.',
  gas: 'The fee paid to execute transactions on Ethereum. Measured in "gwei" (billionths of ETH). Complex flash loan transactions can cost $50–$500+ in gas.',
  mempool: 'The memory pool — a waiting area where unconfirmed transactions sit before being included in a block. Visible to all network participants, making it a hunting ground for MEV searchers.',
  ticks: 'Discrete price points in Uniswap V3 defined by the formula p(i) = 1.0001^i. LPs concentrate capital within specific tick ranges instead of across all prices.',
  passiveLPs: 'Liquidity Providers who deposit assets into AMM pools over long periods without actively managing their positions. They earn fees but are exposed to impermanent loss and toxic flow.',
  oracle: 'A data feed that brings external information (like asset prices) on-chain. Flash loan attacks often target protocols using simple spot-price oracles instead of TWAP or Chainlink.',
  LTV: 'Loan-to-Value ratio — the percentage of collateral value that has been borrowed against. When LTV exceeds the liquidation threshold, the position can be liquidated.',
  flashLoanFee: 'The fee charged by the lending protocol for a flash loan. Aave V3 charges 0.05%, Balancer charges 0%, and Uniswap charges the pool trading fee (0.05%–1%).',
  PBS: 'Proposer-Builder Separation — the architecture where block building (transaction ordering) is separated from block proposing (committing to the chain). Implemented by Flashbots to professionalize MEV extraction.',
  atomicity: 'The property that a transaction either fully completes or fully reverts — there is no partial execution. This is what makes flash loans possible.',
  searcher: 'An algorithmic trader who scans the mempool for MEV opportunities like arbitrage, sandwich attacks, and JIT liquidity. They submit transaction "bundles" to block builders.',
