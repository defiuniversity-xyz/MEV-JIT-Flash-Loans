    section: 'Atomicity',
    question: 'What happens when a flash loan borrower fails to repay within the same transaction?',
    options: [
      'The borrower\'s wallet is penalized with a fee',
      'The entire transaction reverts — the loan never happened on-chain',
      'The lending pool absorbs the loss as bad debt',
      'The transaction is queued for the next block',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'EVM atomicity guarantees all-or-nothing execution. If repayment fails, the REVERT opcode discards all state changes. The lender never loses funds because, on the immutable ledger, the loan never existed.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    section: 'Flash Loans',
    question: 'What is the primary risk model shift introduced by flash loans?',
    options: [
      'From market risk to liquidity risk',
      'From credit risk to smart contract risk',
      'From operational risk to regulatory risk',
      'From systemic risk to counterparty risk',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'In traditional finance, lenders assess credit risk (probability of default). With flash loans, default is impossible due to atomicity. The risk shifts entirely to smart contract risk — is the lending protocol\'s code secure?',
  },

    id: 3,
    section: 'Arbitrage',
    question: 'A trader borrows $5M via flash loan (0.05% fee) to arbitrage a 0.02% price spread. What happens?',
    options: [
      'The trade executes at a loss but the trader keeps the tokens',
      'The transaction reverts — the fee ($2,500) exceeds the profit ($1,000)',
      'The lending pool covers the difference',
      'The trade succeeds because the fee is paid separately',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'The flash loan fee (0.05% = $2,500) plus gas costs would exceed the gross profit from a 0.02% spread ($1,000). The require() check in the lending pool fails, triggering a revert. The trader only loses the gas fee.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    section: 'Attacks',
    question: 'What is the #1 attack vector for flash loan exploits?',
    options: [
      'Reentrancy attacks on lending pools',
      'Governance token manipulation',
      'Price oracle manipulation on DEXs',
      'Front-running block producers',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'The vast majority of flash loan exploits target price oracles. Protocols using spot prices from a single DEX are vulnerable — an attacker can temporarily distort the price with massive capital, exploit the inflated valuation, then restore the price.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    section: 'Protocols',
    question: 'Which flash loan provider charges 0% fees?',
    options: [
      'Aave V3',
      'Uniswap V3',
      'Balancer V2/V3',
      'MakerDAO',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Balancer charges 0% on flash loans from its single-Vault architecture. The strategy is to attract arbitrageurs who keep Balancer pools correctly priced, generating more organic trading volume and fees.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    section: 'MEV',
    question: 'In the MEV supply chain, who constructs the actual blocks?',
    options: [
      'Validators',
      'Searchers',
      'Builders',
      'Relayers',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Block Builders aggregate bundles from Searchers and standard transactions to construct full blocks, optimizing for maximum total value. Validators then select the highest-bidding block and commit it to the chain.',
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    section: 'AMMs',
    question: 'What capital efficiency improvement does Uniswap V3 offer over V2?',
    options: [
      'Up to 10× more efficient',
      'Up to 100× more efficient',
      'Up to 4000× more efficient',
      'Approximately the same efficiency',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Concentrated liquidity in V3 allows LPs to focus capital in narrow price ranges ("ticks"), achieving up to 4000× the capital efficiency of V2\'s uniform distribution where most capital sat idle across all prices.',
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    section: 'JIT Liquidity',
    question: 'How much liquidity does a JIT bot typically need relative to the swap it targets?',
    options: [
      '10× the swap volume',
      '50× the swap volume',
      '269× the swap volume',
      '1000× the swap volume',
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: 'Research from Imperial College London found JIT attacks require an average of 269× the swap volume in liquidity. For a $1M swap, the bot needs ~$269M — making JIT an extremely capital-intensive, low-margin industrial operation.',
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    section: 'JIT Paradox',
    question: 'What is the "JIT Paradox"?',
    options: [
      'JIT makes pools more liquid for everyone',
      'JIT improves execution for large traders but may reduce overall pool liquidity for retail',
      'JIT eliminates impermanent loss for passive LPs',
      'JIT is only profitable during high-volatility markets',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'The paradox: JIT cherry-picks profitable trades (large, uninformed swaps), giving whales better execution (+0.139%). But passive LPs lose ~85% of fee revenue on JIT blocks, potentially causing them to withdraw — "hollowing" the pool for smaller retail traders.',
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    section: 'Security',
    question: 'Why are TWAP oracles more resistant to flash loan attacks than spot price oracles?',
    options: [
      'TWAP oracles are encrypted and cannot be read by attackers',
      'TWAP averages price over multiple blocks — manipulation would need to be sustained, not instant',
      'TWAP oracles only update once per day',
      'TWAP oracles use off-chain data exclusively',
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) calculates the average over the last N blocks. To manipulate a TWAP, an attacker would need to sustain a distorted price across many consecutive blocks — impossible with a single-block flash loan.',
  },
